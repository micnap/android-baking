This Android app fills the requirements for the fourth project of the Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

Overview:
*It retrieves a list of recipes from the web and displays them in cardview.  Clicking on a recipe card takes the user to a detail view of the recipe which includes a list of ingredients and a list of steps.  When the user clicks on a step, the step's details (video, image, and text) are display in a new screen on a phone or to the right of the ingredients/steps list on a tablet in landscape.  Buttons are provided for easy navigation back and forth between the steps.  The step video displays full screen in landscape mode. 

Topics learned through the project include:
*Image optimization
*Use of RecyclerView and ExpandableListView
*App Widget development
*PendingIntents and PendingIntentTemplates
*Use of Exoplayer for displaying video
*Persisting data, scroll location, and video location across rotation
*Data retrieval from network
